            "description": "One of the biggest events of the last console generation is finally striding onto more powerful formats! GTA V finally makes its next-gen debut. With GTA IV having taken place in a decidedly east coast sort of setting in Liberty City, this game takes things over to the west coast. The action takes place in Los Santos and the surrounding countryside of San Andreas. Los Santos has seen better days. A sprawling metropolis full of faded stars, self-help gurus and desperate celebrities, the city has declined somewhat in the face economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. In need of a big score are Franklin, a former street-level gangster; Michael, an ex-con living the high life in witness protection and Trevor, who's a bit on the sociopathic side. These are the three characters through whose eyes you'll see Los Santos. Of course, you'll do a lot more than looking around. The game is centred around six big heists, with plenty of driving, shoot-outs and other assorted missions to get stuck into in between. The open world map is huge, with hours upon hours of content on offer. If you should happen to get through it all, however, there's a whole other side to the game. GTA V also gets you access to GTA Online, a sprawling persistent world for you and up to 15 other players to play in either cooperatively or against each other in traditional competitive modes. With the next-gen version, players get the advantage of higher levels of detail than have ever been seen in GTA before, with better draw distances, finer texture detail and denser traffic to make the city seem more vibrant than ever.",

In Middle-earth: Shadow of War, players wield a new Ring of Power and confront the deadliest of enemies, including Sauron and his Nazgul, in a monumental battle for Middle-earth. The open-world action-adventure game is brought to life through the expansion of the award-winning Nemesis System. The robust personalization from the first game is now applied to the entire world where the environments and characters are all shaped by player actions and decisions, creating a personal world unique to every gameplay experience. The innovative Nemesis System created unique personal stories through procedurally-generated enemies who remember every encounter and are differentiated by their personality, strengths and weaknesses. Middle-earth: Shadow of War expands this innovation with the introduction of Followers who bring about entirely new stories of loyalty, betrayal and revenge. The Nemesis System is also expanded to create a unique personal world through Nemesis Fortresses, which allows players to utilize different strategies to conquer dynamic strongholds and create personalized worlds with their unique Orc army. Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, Middle-earth: Shadow of War continues the original narrative of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Players will be engrossed in a richer, more personal and expansive world full of epic heroes and villains, iconic locations, original enemy types, even more personalities and a new cast of characters with untold stories.",

No country has embraced the car quite like the US, and there's arguably not a game that celebrates that spirit more than The Crew 2, Ubisoft's open-world racing game. There's an inherent glee in barreling right from one cost of the country to the other, hurling yourself round corners at breakneck speeds, piling from the top of buildings and tearing up the cities and landscapes in your wake and accruing multiplier after multiplier, getting rewards piled on top of you as fast as you can drive. The open world of The Crew 2 is limited only by US borders. From the tightly-packed streets of New York to the misty mountains of the Rockies, the country is open to you in all its glory. With the inclusion of planes and power boats, there's really no limit to what you can explore.",

            "description": "After jaunts to every-when from the 1970s to the far-flung future, the Call of Duty series is returning to its roots with Call of Duty: WWII. Once again players will take to the battlegrounds of Europe in a bid to oust the evil of National Socialism from the world, but this time out they'll be doing it on the hardware of 2017 and with the benefit of lessons learned from multiple series installments. Activision and Sledgehammer Games are aiming squarely at the goal of delivering a gritty, cinematic World War II experience. You'll storm the beaches on D-Day, march across France to liberate Paris and ultimately push on for the invasion of Germany. There's even, in multiplayer, a map that offers players a chance to fight in Blitz-torn London. While the series is clearly going back to its roots in one sense, Sledgehammer has clearly learned from the games between the last CoD set in WWII and now. Most obvious is the inclusion of all the usual killstreaks, but CoD aficionados will also note the likes of turret gunning from Modern Warfare 2; maps with a hint of Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare's momentum-driven layouts to them and paratroopers who call back to World at War's attack dogs. There are certainly new additions too, however. War mode is a new narrative-driven multiplayer mode that has Allied and Axis forces clash in team-driven assault and defend missions. Headquarters, meanwhile, is a new social and competitive experience for players, with activities like 1v1 fights, anti-aircraft gunnery and eSports viewing available. Call of Duty: WWII also introduces Nazi Zombies, an all-new co-op experience with its own storyline set against the backdrop of World War II.",

Hidden in the towering Himalayas lies a country steeped in tradition and violence. You are Ajay Ghale, returning to the country of your birth, the lush forests and harsh snowcapped summits of Kyrat, to fulfill your mother's dying wish of spreading her ashes. This striking and unpredictable country offers visitors opportunity and peril. You quickly find yourself caught up in a rebellion to overthrow the oppressive regime of Pagan Min, a man known as much for his sense of style and charisma as his cruelty and calculated brutality. Navigating the treacherous landscape, you find your fate increasingly determined by the choices you make because in Kyrat, every second is a story. In Far Cry 4, you'll conquer fortress outposts from the back of a six-ton elephant and take to the skies as you rain down explosives from the seat of your gyrocopter. The vertical landscape of the Himalayas isn't just a pretty backdrop, but a playground that encourages the player to fight, hunt and explore, grappling up cliffs or launching into the air, plummeting to the valley below in a controlled free fall with your wing suit. You'll carry with you a truly unique arsenal of weaponry that lets you play your way, whether it's sniping, sneaking or all-out assault. When all else fails, animals can be your biggest allies or your greatest danger, as Kyrat's wilderness delivers on the promise of a true open world anecdote factory. For the first time in any Far Cry game, you'll be able to hunt, fight and explore in the open world with a friend. With Guns for Hire, you can invite a friend into your world to liberate towers, take over outposts and share in the spoils. Hurk, from the Monkey Business add-on content of Far Cry 3, joins in the fight to take over Kyrat.",

It's bad news for everyone (except the player) as this arrival accelerates a years-long coup by a murderous doomsday cult, the Project at Eden's Gate, and triggers a violent takeover of the county. Cut off from the rest of the world, players must range over a vast open environment of farmland, forest and mountains, to form a resistance and take it back piece by piece. Much of how Far Cry 5 plays out will be pleasingly familiar to fans of the series. It's still about capturing outposts, hunting wildlife and exploring a massive world, but certain tweaks and a greater emphasis on characters and cooperation change things up a bit. One difference is that everything you do contributes to your 'resistance' meter, and as this increases cult leader Joseph Seed will get more irate, dragging you into story missions and throwing greater defenses at you. Another is a greater emphasis on teamwork. You can play the whole game online in co-op mode, as well as recruit hired guns to help you in your crusade to take back Hope County. You can recruit fighters with different skillsets, adding a greater tactical element to the game than previous series outings. In other words, Far Cry 5 is offering players to get deeper into the game's world than ever before.",

            "description": "As the 2019/2020 season kicks into high gear, EA's FIFA series is back with a host of improvements and one big new twist on its classic formula. With FIFA 20 EA Sports is taking the beautiful game back to the streets for a more casual, creative version of the sports know and love. Pitches are swapped out for courts and cages, sponsored kits are swapped out for casual-wear and tight formations and tactics are swapped out for a more dramatic style of play that's fast and fancy. Configurations include 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 modes, as well as rush, where there's no keeper. Less obvious but no less important are changes that have been made under the hood. EA has been playing around with the pillars of how matches move and flow, crafting what it calls Football Intelligence around 'decisive moments' (play on the ball); 'authentic game flow' (off the ball) and ball physics (which sort of explains itself). As ever, fidelity to real world elements of the game is a big part of FIFA. The UEFA Champions League; UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup are all present, accounted for and fully licensed, complete with official broadcast overlays, kit badges, match balls and trophies. Returning fans will also be glad of returning modes including FIFA 20 Ultimate Team, Career Mode, a standalone Champions League Mode. Basically, EA Sports FIFA 20 is the full package!",

            "description": "It's been a while since tennis fans had a true simulation of the sport to sink their racket into on console - arguably the last one was Top Spin 4, way back in 2011. With that in mind Tennis World Tour will be a very welcome addition to the catalogue, especially as it comes from developers who graduated from PAM Development and 2K Czech, the studios behind the Top Spin series. Tennis World Tour is a spiritual successor of sorts to that series - what the devs would have done if it weren't cancelled. It's been a while, though, and there have been changes. Seasoned players will notice, for example, significant changes to how a shot is delivered. The difficulty of a shot's timing has been softened, but there's a greater emphasis on factors such as where the player is when they get to it, the player's natural handedness and how strong their return ought to be. The aim, along with things like motion capture of whole games of tennis rather than isolated movements, is to produce a more rounded game of tennis. This is reflected in the career mode, which is the heart of the game. Most sports sims will take you through full seasons nowadays, but Tennis World Tour goes a step further in having you plan your progress. You'll need to plan which tournaments to skip and which to attend in order to both aid recovery and to prepare properly for the big events. You might, for example, choose to focus on events on different surfaces in order to cater to your player's strengths. With 30 licensed pros to play as (including the likes of Roger Federer, Angelique Kerber and Stan Wawrinka) and 18 types of courts: hard, clay, grass, carpet and even hardwood there are plenty of variables to contend with and doing well will be as much a matter of strategy as fast reflexes, just like the real game!",

As in the first game, you have to enter a world that's the very definition of a realm of psychological horror - an alternate reality created using someone's very mind. It can warp and change at a moment's notice, and the normal rules don't apply there... It's very much in the Silent Hill mold of tense, nerve-wracking gameplay punctuated by moments of outright visceral horror. There's a vast dark world to explore, and it's constantly shifting and creaking around you. You can choose to play stealthily, attaching from the shadows with a crossbow, go in guns blazing (albeit with very limited ammo) or just run like hell and hope for the best. Whatever you do, however, you'll need to prepare carefully and manage your limited resources wisely. This is a world that's literally out to get you, and it won't be doing you any favours by giving you ready stashes of ammo and supplies.

            "description": "On January 22nd, fans and newcomers will be able to re-visit the original stories that started it all, now brilliantly remastered in Resident Evil Origins Collection, a physical disc product that contains both the critically acclaimed, previously released Resident Evil and the upcoming Resident Evil 0. In the original Resident Evil, players choose to take on the role of either S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team member Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, who have been sent into the city to find the missing Bravo team. With limited ammo and survival items available, gamers need to keep their wits about them to survive the various traps and puzzles that greet them at every stage of the game. This is coupled with the upcoming Resident Evil 0, which takes players back to 1998. Reports have been mounting about unusual murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. The city's Special Forces division, S.T.A.R.S., sends their Bravo Team to investigate, including rookie cop member Rebecca Chambers, who meets death row convict and ex-Navy lieutenant Billy Coen. Throughout the game, players take control of both Rebecca and Billy, at times switching between both characters in order to proceed. FEATURES: - Return to the series' origins - Discover the truth behind the horrors at the Mansion, and all that came before on the Ecliptic Express with this bundle of two fan-favourite titles. - Completely enhanced visuals - Both games now have high-resolution textures that have been created from scratch, including 1080p support on next-gen consoles, while still preserving the classic appearance of the original releases. - Fully remastered sound effects - 5.1 surround support provides a more experiential gaming atmosphere that best matches players' listening environments. - Introducing Wesker Mode - For the first time ever in Resident Evil 0, players can experience the events leading up to the iconic Mansion outbreak playing as alternative character Albert Wesker, including a special themed outfit and amazing new powers. This mode will provide series fans and newcomers with even more ammo to enjoy!",

            "description": "Back in the early days of the PlayStation, Resident Evil was a must-have game. The definitive survival horror game, it aimed to give players the experience of a videogame that delivered the frights and intense atmosphere of a horror movie. The gameplay involved claustrophobic fixed view cameras and required the player to blast at horrific groaning zombies. Two sequels followed for the Sony console, as well as some special editions and a lightgun spin-off. When RE: Code Veronica appeared on the Dreamcast, the graphics and gameplay developed in line with the then-new console's awesome powers. Since then, the series has continued on PS2 in third-person and lightgun versions. In 2002, the franchise came to GameCube with two titles: RE: Zero, an all-new prequel, and Resident Evil, a remake of the original. This remake, regarded as a worthy and laudable endeavour by some, and something of a white elephant by others, was perhaps the first game to show what Nintendo's diminutive and easily underestimated console was really capable of. The terrifying mansion, rendered in real and vibrant 3D rather than pre-rendered graphics, looked amazing. But as new versions arrived on the PS2, it was easy to believe that Capcom were hesitant to commit fully to the Nintendo system. In something of a departure, the fourth instalment in the series proper debuted on GameCube, and was followed inevitably by release on other - more popular - consoles. As a result of the game already having been in the public domain so long, the storyline is well known, but here's a quick thumbnail for you: the horrific incidents at Raccoon City now exist only in the memories of those who witnessed them. Leon, a US Secret Agent, is assigned to investigate the kidnapping of the President's daughter, and is led to a rural part of Europe in his quest. When he stops to ask directions, he is attacked by hideous monsters that he had assumed were human. Now his only choice is to battle for survival and hope to somehow find what the source of the creatures is. As well as having still very impressive graphics, the game is now played in a free-roaming environment rather than a series of fixed viewpoint scenes. Most exciting for horror fans is the inclusion of a new weapon, the shotgun, which tears chunks out of more than one enemy at a time; it's just as well, because ammo is limited. The creatures you battle all react convincingly depending on where you shoot them. This HD remake brings all the tension of the original to modern consoles, along with a thick coat of HD polish.",

The fifth game in the series had a lot to live up to, with Resident Evil 4 holding a very special place in the hearts of survival horror fans. The game sees long-time Resident Evil hero, Chris Redfield, thrust back into the thick of things. And by 'things' we mean 'horde of zombie killers hungry for squelchy brains'. Having chased the undead around the globe and now working for a new organisation, Redfield heads to Africa where a terrifying new bioterrorism threat has emerged. It's turning the people and animals into mindless killers, and it needs sorting out. Redfield isn't alone. He'll have Sheva Alomar to lend her strength, speed and sharpshooting to his efforts. Sheva's presence is crucial to the game's core mechanics, as she enables both online and offline co-op play. Even when you're just playing with the AI, Redfield and Sheva will get to the serious business of slaying zombies together and you'll need to watch each other's backs to survive. As with past Resi titles, gameplay is tight and tense. You'll have to be ruthlessly efficient as you pop off headshots and try to conserve your limited ammo. Keeping a cool head is the name of the game! Not necessarily so easy, since you're in Africa...",

            "description": "Resident Evil is one of the best selling, and longest lasting franchises in gaming history. And although this is the sixth main game in the series, when all of the Survivor, Code, Outbreak, Chronicles and other games have been taken into account, over 20 games have born the Resident Evil name. The original game virtually invented the survival horror genre. And wile each subsequent iteration has moved the game more to a real time action style, the all important atmosphere of the original has always been a core part of the games' special appeal. Set in Easter Europe, RE 6 lets users play through three storylines, each of which is interconnected, but has its own feel and its own main playable character, either Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Jake Muller. As with RE 5, the playable character is accompanied by a secondary character which is either computer controlled in the single player game, or can be controlled by a friend either locally or on-line. Once you complete all three of the scenarios, a fourth - in which you play Ada Wong in purely solo gameplay, is unlocked. After listening to user feedback from the fifth game, Capcom has made gameplay in RE 6 more fluid and fast moving. Items can now be picked up in real time and you can switch between weapons smoothly more quickly. Players can also target their weapon while moving, being unable to do so was a frustrating limitation of previous games in the series, but your speed of motion is restricted while you are using your firearm. Health can be restored by finding herbs and using them to create tablets, and thee is some strategy involved in using the resources most effectively. Tablets canbe used to revive your partner character too, but if either of you die, the game re-sets tot he last restore point. The shambling zombie foe of the previous game are joined by the J'avo - which can communicate and co-operate to plan their attacks, use weapons and heal one another. When killed some enemies release skill points which may be used to level up certain player characteristics. Resident Evil 6 aims to combine all that is familiar and popular from the previous games in the series, and introduce enough new thrills to keep even the most experienced RE player entertained.",

What you need to know is: you have to save the teensies by crusading through various levels roughly themed around fairytales/folklore. You navigate the different worlds/levels by wandering along galleries and hopping into paintings with various different themes attached to them. If you wander about the level navigation for a moment you're bound to find something to do, and linearity is hardly important here. The game plays and flows beautifully, with some really imaginative level design. It does everything you expect from a sidescrolling platformer: you run, you jump, you glide, you punch. Except it does all this with really rich, varied and imaginative level design. Legends sits somewhere between 2D Mario and old school Sonic in terms of the feel of the thing, leaning more toward the latter. It's not as quick as Sonic, but if you're good enough it has something of that smooth flow. There are various sorts of levels on offer. For example, once certain levels are completed, a secondary level re-using some of its features (you might call it a 'remix' at a push) opens up. These are speed runs, but accuracy is critical if you even want to make it through, let alone do so in reasonable time. Using Murfy adds some fun moments, too. Players can get him to perform certain actions like tickling large enemies or eating out sections of cake-based levels, adding a rewarding extra dimension to certain levels. Rayman Legends is, all in all, a really fun little game with some great design behind it.",

Not content to settle on just Spider-Man, the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four... or any of the other Marvel characters that could have held their own game, the developer has thrown the whole lot into the mix! Characters available range from the likes of Iron Man and Captain America through Spidey and the Fantastic Four right across to X-Men such as Wolverine, Cyclops and Storm. The Silver Surfer has turned up on Earth, which is often bad news. You see, the Surfer is the herald of Galactus, devourer of worlds, so where he goes Galactus isn't usually far behind. Before he can do much, however, he's knocked out of the sky and his surfboard is destroyed by Doctor Doom. It falls to Earth as cosmic bricks of immense power, and the Marvel universe's assorted villains scramble to get hold of them. Cue the assembled Marvel heroes to fight them off! The game plays out in the familiar LEGO manner. Gameplay is a combination of platforming, brawling and puzzle solving. There's a strong emphasis on teamwork, whether you're playing solo or in co-op, using the right character for the right job is crucial. As with LEGO Batman 2, there's a whole open world for players to explore. With Marvel, that's the iconic city of New York, with famous locations such as Stark Tower and the X-Mansion!

            "description": "It's been a while coming but, finally, one of the most popular LEGO games of all time has a sequel. The time travelling baddie Kang the Conqueror has really gone all-out this time, pulling chunks of space and time together to form the strange and perilous city of Chronopolis. It's a concept that might be recognisable to Marvel fans who read the Secret Wars crossover event in 2015, and readers of that story know it's ripe for fun and interesting stories. It falls, of course, to the Marvel heroes to set things straight. The Guardians of the Galaxy are front and centre, but there's a deep (and sometimes bewildering!) bench of characters to play around with here. From marquee names like Captain America and Thor right through to obscure figures from deep in the annals of Marvel history such as Forbush Man and Greenskyn Smashtroll, TT Games has really taken the plunge on this one. The developer has also really done its homework on realising the wide array of powers the heroes have, too, especially with new teleportation and time-bending mechanics. Alongside the main story missions, which take you through realms ranging from medieval England to the shady New York of Spider-Man Noir, there are shorter levels introduced by third wall smashing Gwenpool that have you playing as fan favourites such as Squirrel Girl. In short, LEGO Marvel Superheroes 2 is a highly polished love letter to not only the characters it contains, but to 70+ years of Marvel comics.",

            "description": "One of the biggest events of the last console generation is finally striding onto more powerful formats! GTA V finally makes its next-gen debut. With GTA IV having taken place in a decidedly east coast sort of setting in Liberty City, this game takes things over to the west coast. The action takes place in Los Santos and the surrounding countryside of San Andreas. Los Santos has seen better days. A sprawling metropolis full of faded stars, self-help gurus and desperate celebrities, the city has declined somewhat in the face economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. In need of a big score are Franklin, a former street-level gangster; Michael, an ex-con living the high life in witness protection and Trevor, who's a bit on the sociopathic side. These are the three characters through whose eyes you'll see Los Santos. Of course, you'll do a lot more than looking around. The game is centred around six big heists, with plenty of driving, shoot-outs and other assorted missions to get stuck into in between. The open world map is huge, with hours upon hours of content on offer. If you should happen to get through it all, however, there's a whole other side to the game. GTA V also gets you access to GTA Online, a sprawling persistent world for you and up to 15 other players to play in either cooperatively or against each other in traditional competitive modes. With the next-gen version, players get the advantage of higher levels of detail than have ever been seen in GTA before, with better draw distances, finer texture detail and denser traffic to make the city seem more vibrant than ever.",

            "description": "After jaunts to every-when from the 1970s to the far-flung future, the Call of Duty series is returning to its roots with Call of Duty: WWII. Once again players will take to the battlegrounds of Europe in a bid to oust the evil of National Socialism from the world, but this time out they'll be doing it on the hardware of 2017 and with the benefit of lessons learned from multiple series installments. Activision and Sledgehammer Games are aiming squarely at the goal of delivering a gritty, cinematic World War II experience. You'll storm the beaches on D-Day, march across France to liberate Paris and ultimately push on for the invasion of Germany. There's even, in multiplayer, a map that offers players a chance to fight in Blitz-torn London. While the series is clearly going back to its roots in one sense, Sledgehammer has clearly learned from the games between the last CoD set in WWII and now. Most obvious is the inclusion of all the usual killstreaks, but CoD aficionados will also note the likes of turret gunning from Modern Warfare 2; maps with a hint of Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare's momentum-driven layouts to them and paratroopers who call back to World at War's attack dogs. There are certainly new additions too, however. War mode is a new narrative-driven multiplayer mode that has Allied and Axis forces clash in team-driven assault and defend missions. Headquarters, meanwhile, is a new social and competitive experience for players, with activities like 1v1 fights, anti-aircraft gunnery and eSports viewing available. Call of Duty: WWII also introduces Nazi Zombies, an all-new co-op experience with its own storyline set against the backdrop of World War II.",

            "description": "Activision and its developers have been inching towards science fiction with the Call of Duty franchise for years now, but with Infinite Warfare they've finally taken the plunge. In the campaign mode you play as Captain Reyes, a Tier 1 Special Operations pilot at the helm of the Retribution, one of Earth's last remaining warships, in a conflict not just for our planet, but for the whole solar system. See, in Infinite Warfare's future the Earth's resources are spent and our world relies on colonies spread across the solar system to provide it with resources. Not all the colonies are happy with this set-up, though, and the fascist SetDef, hardened by years in extreme environments, seeks to control these outposts and put a stranglehold on the countries of Earth. It's into this conflict that you step. As is befitting this interplanetary set-up, the action takes place across a wide array of environments that bring their own twists on gameplay. In particular, Infinity Ward has included zero-g combat, in which players can move around using a grappling hook and attempt to outflank their enemies. One example is a rapidly-spinning, airless asteroid that's repeatedly baked in searing sunlight. It doesn't get much more tense than that... Another big addition is the Jackal, a futuristic fighter jet that players can take control of. This backdrop will bring brand new challenges to the game's multiplayer, with maps that are designed to leverage tweaks to Call of Duty's movement system for faster, more frenetic play than ever. All this sci-fi action means we get an interesting twist on zombies mode. Zombies in Spaceland takes players back in time to a 1980s amusement park with its After Life Arcade, Fate & Fortune Cards and brand new team mechanics. The Legacy Edition comes with a huge extra treat, too. Modern Warfare Remastered is packed in there, bringing the Call of Duty classic to current generation consoles with a graphical overhaul, iconic campaign and 10 fan favourite multiplayer maps!",

            "description": "Activision and its developers have been inching towards science fiction with the Call of Duty franchise for years now, but with Infinite Warfare they've finally taken the plunge. In the campaign mode you play as Captain Reyes, a Tier 1 Special Operations pilot at the helm of the Retribution, one of Earth's last remaining warships, in a conflict not just for our planet, but for the whole solar system. See, in Infinite Warfare's future the Earth's resources are spent and our world relies on colonies spread across the solar system to provide it with resources. Not all the colonies are happy with this set-up, though, and the fascist SetDef, hardened by years in extreme environments, seeks to control these outposts and put a stranglehold on the countries of Earth. It's into this conflict that you step.",

            "description": "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare takes the stellar blockbuster franchise and shifts it in a new direction. The biggest change for fans of the Call of Duty series will be the fact that for the first time, development isn't led by series veterans Infinity Ward or Treyarch, but by relative newcomer Sledgehammer Games. With a new team comes a somewhat new direction. While Call of Duty: Black Ops II pushed things into the near future of 2025, Advanced Warfare takes things further. The game puts players in the futuristic gear of Jack Mitchell. It's a future where the world has been devastated by a global attack and Atlas, a Private Military Corporation, is effectively a superpower for hire. Activision has gone to pains to state that this is a carefully researched future, so don't expect black hole guns or laser blasters. The most immediate impact of this premise, then, is the exoskeleton players wear. This piece of kit enhances the player's movement with bigger leaps, dashes and dodges. The exoskeleton, along with the futuristic weaponry on offer, changes the way gamers will play Call of Duty, and of course that extends to the game's multiplayer. All of this is polished off with a revamped Create-a-Class feature, offering the deepest customisation options in a Call of Duty game yet.",

It's bad news for everyone (except the player) as this arrival accelerates a years-long coup by a murderous doomsday cult, the Project at Eden's Gate, and triggers a violent takeover of the county. Cut off from the rest of the world, players must range over a vast open environment of farmland, forest and mountains, to form a resistance and take it back piece by piece. Much of how Far Cry 5 plays out will be pleasingly familiar to fans of the series. It's still about capturing outposts, hunting wildlife and exploring a massive world, but certain tweaks and a greater emphasis on characters and cooperation change things up a bit. One difference is that everything you do contributes to your 'resistance' meter, and as this increases cult leader Joseph Seed will get more irate, dragging you into story missions and throwing greater defenses at you. Another is a greater emphasis on teamwork. You can play the whole game online in co-op mode, as well as recruit hired guns to help you in your crusade to take back Hope County. You can recruit fighters with different skillsets, adding a greater tactical element to the game than previous series outings. In other words, Far Cry 5 is offering players to get deeper into the game's world than ever before.",

With FIFA 20 EA Sports is taking the beautiful game back to the streets for a more casual, creative version of the sports know and love. Pitches are swapped out for courts and cages, sponsored kits are swapped out for casual-wear and tight formations and tactics are swapped out for a more dramatic style of play that's fast and fancy. Configurations include 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 modes, as well as rush, where there's no keeper. Less obvious but no less important are changes that have been made under the hood. EA has been playing around with the pillars of how matches move and flow, crafting what it calls Football Intelligence around 'decisive moments' (play on the ball); 'authentic game flow' (off the ball) and ball physics (which sort of explains itself). As ever, fidelity to real world elements of the game is a big part of FIFA. The UEFA Champions League; UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup are all present, accounted for and fully licensed, complete with official broadcast overlays, kit badges, match balls and trophies. Returning fans will also be glad of returning modes including FIFA 20 Ultimate Team, Career Mode, a standalone Champions League Mode. Basically, EA Sports FIFA 20 is the full package!",

Players take on the role of both killer and survivors in a deadly game of cat and mouse. It's a Mature Gamer take on the thrills of Hide & Seek. Players experience two styles of gameplay -- as a survivor, from third-person perspective; or the killer, in first-person perspective. Survivors can work together or act alone using their situational awareness, while killers are on the hunt in first-person, focused on their prey. With a dynamic environment that changes after every playthrough, players must find new ways to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught. Features: A Feast for Killers: Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. Play anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entity. Players can familiarise themselves with the Killing Grounds and master each killer's unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice victims. Deeper and Deeper: Each killer and survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customised to fit each player's own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the killer. Real Fear: Expect the unexpected. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, players might even discover what's hiding in the fog. Survive Together... Or Not: Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Chances for survival depend on player's decisions. Where Am I? Each level is procedurally generated, so players never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean players will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every playthrough.",

As in the first game, you have to enter a world that's the very definition of a realm of psychological horror - an alternate reality created using someone's very mind. It can warp and change at a moment's notice, and the normal rules don't apply there...

There's a vast dark world to explore, and it's constantly shifting and creaking around you. You can choose to play stealthily, attaching from the shadows with a crossbow, go in guns blazing (albeit with very limited ammo) or just run like hell and hope for the best. Whatever you do, however, you'll need to prepare carefully and manage your limited resources wisely. This is a world that's literally out to get you, and it won't be doing you any favours by giving you ready stashes of ammo and supplies.

            "description": "Back in the early days of the PlayStation, Resident Evil was a must-have game. The definitive survival horror game, it aimed to give players the experience of a videogame that delivered the frights and intense atmosphere of a horror movie. The gameplay involved claustrophobic fixed view cameras and required the player to blast at horrific groaning zombies. Two sequels followed for the Sony console, as well as some special editions and a lightgun spin-off. When RE: Code Veronica appeared on the Dreamcast, the graphics and gameplay developed in line with the then-new console's awesome powers. Since then, the series has continued on PS2 in third-person and lightgun versions. In 2002, the franchise came to GameCube with two titles: RE: Zero, an all-new prequel, and Resident Evil, a remake of the original. This remake, regarded as a worthy and laudable endeavour by some, and something of a white elephant by others, was perhaps the first game to show what Nintendo's diminutive and easily underestimated console was really capable of. The terrifying mansion, rendered in real and vibrant 3D rather than pre-rendered graphics, looked amazing. But as new versions arrived on the PS2, it was easy to believe that Capcom were hesitant to commit fully to the Nintendo system. In something of a departure, the fourth instalment in the series proper debuted on GameCube, and was followed inevitably by release on other - more popular - consoles. As a result of the game already having been in the public domain so long, the storyline is well known, but here's a quick thumbnail for you: the horrific incidents at Raccoon City now exist only in the memories of those who witnessed them. Leon, a US Secret Agent, is assigned to investigate the kidnapping of the President's daughter, and is led to a rural part of Europe in his quest. When he stops to ask directions, he is attacked by hideous monsters that he had assumed were human. Now his only choice is to battle for survival and hope to somehow find what the source of the creatures is. As well as having still very impressive graphics, the game is now played in a free-roaming environment rather than a series of fixed viewpoint scenes. Most exciting for horror fans is the inclusion of a new weapon, the shotgun, which tears chunks out of more than one enemy at a time; it's just as well, because ammo is limited. The creatures you battle all react convincingly depending on where you shoot them. This HD remake brings all the tension of the original to modern consoles, along with a thick coat of HD polish.",

Sheva's presence is crucial to the game's core mechanics, as she enables both online and offline co-op play. Even when you're just playing with the AI, Redfield and Sheva will get to the serious business of slaying zombies together and you'll need to watch each other's backs to survive. As with past Resi titles, gameplay is tight and tense. You'll have to be ruthlessly efficient as you pop off headshots and try to conserve your limited ammo.

            "description": "Resident Evil is one of the best selling, and longest lasting franchises in gaming history. And although this is the sixth main game in the series, when all of the Survivor, Code, Outbreak, Chronicles and other games have been taken into account, over 20 games have born the Resident Evil name. The original game virtually invented the survival horror genre. And wile each subsequent iteration has moved the game more to a real time action style, the all important atmosphere of the original has always been a core part of the games' special appeal. Set in Easter Europe, RE 6 lets users play through three storylines, each of which is interconnected, but has its own feel and its own main playable character, either Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Jake Muller. As with RE 5, the playable character is accompanied by a secondary character which is either computer controlled in the single player game, or can be controlled by a friend either locally or on-line. Once you complete all three of the scenarios, a fourth - in which you play Ada Wong in purely solo gameplay, is unlocked. After listening to user feedback from the fifth game, Capcom has made gameplay in RE 6 more fluid and fast moving. Items can now be picked up in real time and you can switch between weapons smoothly more quickly. Players can also target their weapon while moving, being unable to do so was a frustrating limitation of previous games in the series, but your speed of motion is restricted while you are using your firearm. Health can be restored by finding herbs and using them to create tablets, and thee is some strategy involved in using the resources most effectively. Tablets canbe used to revive your partner character too, but if either of you die, the game re-sets tot he last restore point. The shambling zombie foe of the previous game are joined by the J'avo - which can communicate and co-operate to plan their attacks, use weapons and heal one another. When killed some enemies release skill points which may be used to level up certain player characteristics. Resident Evil 6 aims to combine all that is familiar and popular from the previous games in the series, and introduce enough new thrills to keep even the most experienced RE player entertained.",

            "description": "Rayman, Globox, and the teensies have been wandering through the forest when... you know, things happen. Don't sweat the details. What you need to know is: you have to save the teensies by crusading through various levels roughly themed around fairytales/folklore. You navigate the different worlds/levels by wandering along galleries and hopping into paintings with various different themes attached to them. If you wander about the level navigation for a moment you're bound to find something to do, and linearity is hardly important here. The game plays and flows beautifully, with some really imaginative level design. It does everything you expect from a sidescrolling platformer: you run, you jump, you glide, you punch. Except it does all this with really rich, varied and imaginative level design. Legends sits somewhere between 2D Mario and old school Sonic in terms of the feel of the thing, leaning more toward the latter. It's not as quick as Sonic, but if you're good enough it has something of that smooth flow. There are various sorts of levels on offer. For example, once certain levels are completed, a secondary level re-using some of its features (you might call it a 'remix' at a push) opens up. These are speed runs, but accuracy is critical if you even want to make it through, let alone do so in reasonable time. Using Murfy adds some fun moments, too. Players can get him to perform certain actions like tickling large enemies or eating out sections of cake-based levels, adding a rewarding extra dimension to certain levels. Rayman Legends is, all in all, a really fun little game with some great design behind it.",

            "description": "It had to happen sooner or later, and now it has. The Marvel Universe has been given the LEGO treatment. And developer Traveller's Tales hasn't left anything out, either. Not content to settle on just Spider-Man, the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four... or any of the other Marvel characters that could have held their own game, the developer has thrown the whole lot into the mix! Characters available range from the likes of Iron Man and Captain America through Spidey and the Fantastic Four right across to X-Men such as Wolverine, Cyclops and Storm. The Silver Surfer has turned up on Earth, which is often bad news. You see, the Surfer is the herald of Galactus, devourer of worlds, so where he goes Galactus isn't usually far behind. Before he can do much, however, he's knocked out of the sky and his surfboard is destroyed by Doctor Doom. It falls to Earth as cosmic bricks of immense power, and the Marvel universe's assorted villains scramble to get hold of them. Cue the assembled Marvel heroes to fight them off! The game plays out in the familiar LEGO manner. Gameplay is a combination of platforming, brawling and puzzle solving. There's a strong emphasis on teamwork, whether you're playing solo or in co-op, using the right character for the right job is crucial. As with LEGO Batman 2, there's a whole open world for players to explore. With Marvel, that's the iconic city of New York, with famous locations such as Stark Tower and the X-Mansion! LEGO Marvel is a definite win for any family member of the family who's taken a shine to the world's mightiest heroes.",

            "description": "The baddies of the DC Universe just can't catch a break. The disappearance of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the rest of the Justice League should mean planet Earth is open for business as far as its resident ne'er-do-wells are concerned. Alas, no sooner do they disappear than a gang of replacements from Earth 3 show up. The Justice Syndicate - the suspiciously familiar Ultraman, Owlman, Superwoman and their pals - are a tad (read A LOT) less well meaning than their counterparts, however, and the DC villains just aren't going to let this racket stand. What follows is an epic and bad-to-the-bone team-up of the DC Universe's most corrupt characters, with the likes of the Joker, Lex Luthor, Harley Quinn and Darkseid accompanied by more obscure sorts such as Calendar Man and Condiment King (no, we didn't make him up). In a departure from previous LEGO games, however, your own custom character isn't relegated to open world exploration and takes centre stage in the story mode. You can build them from the ground up, including choosing their powers. Furthermore, the ability to acquire new abilities as you go means you won't need to swap around characters as often as in other LEGO games. Gameplay is, as ever, a light blend of platforming, puzzle solving and combat, with plenty of laughs sprinkled throughout. That's helped, of course, by the inclusion of familiar voice talent such as Mark Hamill playing the Joker. Beyond the main game you can explore iconic locations such as Metropolis, Gotham and Smallville, completing side missions for other villains and generally causing chaos. You might, of course, attract the attention of the authorities (you're a criminal, after all) and, in a nice touch, find yourself in a Grand Theft Auto style 'wanted' challenge. It's good to be good, but it's better to be bad. Take your dark side out for a spin...",

The time travelling baddie Kang the Conqueror has really gone all-out this time, pulling chunks of space and time together to form the strange and perilous city of Chronopolis. It's a concept that might be recognisable to Marvel fans who read the Secret Wars crossover event in 2015, and readers of that story know it's ripe for fun and interesting stories. It falls, of course, to the Marvel heroes to set things straight. The Guardians of the Galaxy are front and centre, but there's a deep (and sometimes bewildering!) bench of characters to play around with here. From marquee names like Captain America and Thor right through to obscure figures from deep in the annals of Marvel history such as Forbush Man and Greenskyn Smashtroll, TT Games has really taken the plunge on this one. The developer has also really done its homework on realising the wide array of powers the heroes have, too, especially with new teleportation and time-bending mechanics. Alongside the main story missions, which take you through realms ranging from medieval England to the shady New York of Spider-Man Noir, there are shorter levels introduced by third wall smashing Gwenpool that have you playing as fan favourites such as Squirrel Girl. In short, LEGO Marvel Superheroes 2 is a highly polished love letter to not only the characters it contains, but to 70+ years of Marvel comics.",
